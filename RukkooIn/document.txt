– Hotel Booking Mediator Platform (MERN Stack)
🔹 Project Overview

Build a full-stack hotel booking platform using Vite + React.js + Tailwind CSS + Node.js (MERN) that acts as a mediator between customers and hotels.

The platform helps:

Customers find the best hotels based on their requirements

Hotels/Vendors increase revenue through bookings

Admin (Platform Owner) earn through ads + commissions

The product should be fully modular, mobile-first, high-performance, and animation-rich, similar in experience to OYO or other hotel booking apps.

🔹 Tech Stack & Tools
Frontend

Vite + React.js

Tailwind CSS (centralized theme & tokens)

GSAP → complex scroll & entrance animations

Framer Motion → micro-interactions & UI transitions

Lenis → smooth scrolling experience

Component Libraries (Radix UI / ShadCN / Headless UI)

Icon Libraries (Lucide / Heroicons)

Backend

Node.js + Express.js

MongoDB + Mongoose

JWT Authentication

Role-Based Access Control

REST APIs (scalable & modular)

Others

Wallet & Transaction System

Live Location Tracking

Notification System

Analytics Dashboard

🔹 Application Architecture

The application must be fully modular with three independent yet connected modules, all fully responsive:

1️⃣ Master Admin Module
2️⃣ Customer/User Module
3️⃣ Hotel/Vendor Module

Each module must have:

Independent dashboards

Secure authentication

Role-specific features

Mobile + tablet + desktop support

🔹 Core Business Logic
🏨 Hotel Ownership & Commission Model

Some hotels are admin-owned → 0% commission

Other hotels are vendor-owned

Platform charges 15–20% commission per booking

Commission rules configurable from admin panel

🔹 Wallet System (Very Important)

Implement a centralized Wallet System:

Wallet Users:

Customers

Hotels/Vendors

Admin

Wallet Features:

Add / withdraw balance

Booking payments

Commission deduction

Referral rewards

Refund handling

Transaction history & invoices

🔹 Live Location Tracking (Security Feature)

Purpose:

Prevent hotels from bypassing the platform and avoiding commission

Features:

Track customer live location during booking journey

Admin can see:

Active booking status

Customer movement (limited & privacy-safe)

Used only for fraud prevention

🔹 Advanced Filtering System

Filters must include:

Location / Area wise

Price range

Rating

Recommended / Popular

Verified hotels

Amenities

Availability

Admin-owned vs Vendor-owned

Filtering must be:

Fast

Dynamic

User-friendly

🔹 Referral & Earn System

Customers can refer new users

Referral reward credited directly to wallet

Referral history & earnings dashboard

Configurable referral reward rules (admin)

🔹 Verified Badge System

Skeleton loaders & empty states

Accessibility-friendly design

🔹 Development Guidelines
