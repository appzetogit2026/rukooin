Just clarity.

👉 Once this exists, vibe coding becomes EASY.

🎨 PHASE 3 — UI FIRST (NO BACKEND YET)
🎯 Goal

Make the app look real in 2–3 days.

Build in this order:
Day 1

Landing Page

Navbar

Footer

Hotel Card Component

Dummy hotel list (static data)

Day 2

Hotel Listing Page

Filters UI (no logic)

Hotel Details Page

Booking CTA (fake)

Day 3

User Dashboard UI

Hotel Dashboard UI

Admin Dashboard UI (cards only)

🚫 No auth
🚫 No APIs
🚫 No database

Just UI + vibes.

✨ PHASE 4 — ANIMATIONS (EARLY, NOT LAST)
Where to use what:
GSAP

Page entrances

Scroll-based reveals

Hero section animations

Framer Motion

Buttons

Cards hover

Modals

Page transitions

Lenis

Global smooth scrolling

📌 Rule:

If animation doesn’t improve UX → delete it.

🔑 PHASE 5 — AUTH SYSTEM (Backend Starts)
Roles

USER

HOTEL

ADMIN

Build Order

💳 PHASE 7 — WALLET SYSTEM (IMPORTANT)

Admin-owned hotels → 0% commission

Features

⚠️ Build wallet before referral & ads.

📍 PHASE 8 — LIVE TRACKING (Security Feature)
Purpose

Prevent hotels from bypassing platform.

Flow

During booking → capture user location

Active bookings

Customer movement (limited)

🔐 Privacy-safe, booking-only tracking.

🔍 PHASE 9 — FILTER SYSTEM (Performance-Focused)

Frontend = fast UI only.

🎁 PHASE 10 — REFERRAL & VERIFIED BADGE

Impacts ranking

🧠 PHASE 11 — ADMIN POWER TOOLS
